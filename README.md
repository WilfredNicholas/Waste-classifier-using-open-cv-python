# Waste-classifier-using-open-cv-python

 I’d like to share with you a project I developed called the Waste Classifier. This project was created using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras. It addresses a real-world problem of waste management by efficiently classifying waste into different categories, which can ultimately help in recycling efforts.
I used three main technologies to build this classifier:

OpenCV – to handle image processing tasks.
TensorFlow and Keras – for building and training the neural network models that recognize different types of waste.

Here’s how the system works:

First, images of waste are captured using a camera or are input into the system.
These images undergo preprocessing using OpenCV. The preprocessing includes resizing, normalization, and applying filters to enhance features.
The preprocessed images are then passed into a neural network model built using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a dataset containing various waste categories, such as plastic, glass, metal, paper, and organic waste.
Based on the input image, the model predicts the category of the waste. It returns the category label, which can then be used by sorting machinery or humans to place the item in the correct bin.

To wrap it up, the Waste Classifier is a small yet impactful project that uses AI and machine learning to contribute to a sustainable future. I'm very excited about the potential applications of this technology in improving recycling processes and helping the environment. Thank you for watching, and feel free to connect with me to discuss more about AI, computer vision, or any other tech-related projects
